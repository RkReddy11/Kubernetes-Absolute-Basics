Docker:

Docker is an open-source platform that provides a complete set of tools and a runtime environment for building, packaging, and distributing applications in containers.
It includes various components like Docker Engine, Docker CLI, and Docker images.
Docker Engine: It is the runtime component that runs and manages containers on the host system. It handles the creation, execution, and monitoring of containers.
Docker CLI: It is the command-line interface that allows users to interact with Docker. It provides commands for building, running, and managing containers.
Docker images: Images are the building blocks of containers. They are read-only templates containing everything needed to run an application, including the code, dependencies, libraries, and configuration.
Docker allows developers to easily package their applications and dependencies into portable containers, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across different environments.
It provides a user-friendly interface and a wide range of features for managing containers, networking, storage, and orchestration of applications.
Containerd:

Containerd is an open-source container runtime that focuses on the execution and management of containers.
It is designed to be lightweight and modular, providing a minimalistic runtime environment for containers.
Containerd acts as a lower-level component, responsible for fundamental container operations, such as container lifecycle management, image handling, and low-level container runtime tasks.
It provides a client-server architecture, where the containerd daemon runs as a background service and exposes an API for container management.
Containerd is often used as a runtime engine within higher-level container platforms and orchestration systems, such as Docker and Kubernetes.
Unlike Docker, Containerd does not provide a user-friendly interface or high-level features like container building or orchestration. It focuses on the core container runtime functionality.
In summary, Docker is a comprehensive platform that includes tools, runtime, and a user-friendly interface for building, packaging, and managing containers. It provides a complete solution for containerization and offers features like container building, networking, storage management, and orchestration. On the other hand, Containerd is a lightweight container runtime that focuses on the core container execution and management tasks. It acts as a lower-level component, providing essential container runtime functionality to be used within higher-level container platforms or orchestration systems.
